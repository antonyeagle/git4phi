When software developers work on complex programming projects, they use something called a /revision control system/. A revision control system allows them to keep track of changes in their code -- if functions as a history of changes, and allows them to quickly and easily take back ('revert') changes that turn out to break things.  It also makes is easy to collaborate with others: multiple contributors can edit and add code, and the revision control system automatically integrates changes when possible, and alerts contributors to conflicts when it isn't.
